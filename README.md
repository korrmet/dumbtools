# dumbtools
born as part of another project but refactored-out

# Overview

This repo contains tiny and dumb replacement for some standard functions of c
library. When i refactored another project some pieces of code were formed in
something like standard functions. They were have unique interfaces so few
iterations later they becomes as a standard functions replacement with 
compitable signature. They are unsafe but tiny so you can use it in systems with
small memory. But mainly it saved as a proof what right refactor excludes not
necessary elements and turn your project to unification.
